# Microservice.Email

Used models:
GPT-5.2 - for creating tasks from project documentation, readme(s)
Claude Haiku 4.5 - for building project codebase, covering project by unit tests

Step by step project work flow:

1. Created empty public repository Microservice.Email.
2. Used vscode copilot integration to generate .gitignore file. Prompt (used model GPT-5.2): Create .gitignore file in project root directory. Use .NET + React TS pattern for .gitignore file.
3. Created technical, contracts, codestyle documentation by myself to define project boundaries and domain area.
