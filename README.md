# Microservice.Email

Used AI-assisted tooling:
GPT-5.2 - for creating tasks from project documentation, readme(s)
Claude Haiku 4.5 - for building project codebase, covering project by unit tests
Used code review tools provided by copilot.

Step by step project workflow:

1. Created empty public repository Microservice.Email.
2. Used vscode copilot integration to generate .gitignore file. Prompt (used model GPT-5.2): Create .gitignore file in project root directory. Use .NET + React TS stack for a .gitignore file.
3. Created technical, contracts, codestyle documentation by myself to define project boundaries and the domain area.
