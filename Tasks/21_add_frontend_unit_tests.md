# Task 21: Add Frontend Unit Tests

## Description
Implement unit tests for React components and frontend services.

## Requirements
- Setup testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library
- Create test files for:
  - API service - Mock Axios and test API calls
  - Redux reducers and actions - Test state changes
  - Components - Test rendering and user interactions
  - Utility functions - Test business logic
- Test cases should cover:
  - Component rendering
  - User interactions (clicks, form submissions)
  - State updates
  - API call failures and success
  - Edge cases (empty lists, missing data)
- Use mocking for API calls
- Use snapshot testing for component rendering
- Target minimum 70% code coverage

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tests pass successfully
- API service tests are implemented
- Component tests cover user interactions
- Redux tests verify state management
- Coverage is at least 70%
